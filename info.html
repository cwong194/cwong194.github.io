            <h3>History of Dixit</h3>
            <p><b>Dixit</b>, designed by <i>Jean-Louis Roubira</i>, was first published in 2008 by Libellud. 
                The game quickly became famous for its unique storytelling concept through abstract graphic.</p>
            <p>Inspired by surrealism and dreamlike imagery, Dixit's cards feature beautiful and imaginative artwork
                created by Marie Cardouat. The game's title <i>"Dixit"</i> is derived from the Latin word "dixit," meaning <i>"he/she
                said."</i> This essence of storytelling is central to the game's mechanics.</p>
            <p>Over the years, Dixit has received numerous awards and trophies, becoming a beloved classic in the board
                gaming community. Its expansion packs have added new layers of creativity, ensuring that each play
                experience remains fresh and delightful.</p>

            <h3>How to Play?</h3>
            <p>Dixit is a game for 3 to 6 players, suitable for ages 8 and above. The game revolves around storytelling
                and creativity, where players take turns being the storyteller.</p>
            <p>During each turn, the storyteller selects one of their hand cards and gives a clue or phrase related to it.
                The clue can be a word, a short sentence, a sound, or even a gesture. The other players then select a card
                from their own hand that best matches the clue and submit it face-down.</p>
            <p>All submitted cards, including the storyteller's card, are shuffled and revealed. Players then vote on which
                card they think belongs to the storyteller based on the clue given. The objective is to find a balance
                between giving a clue that is neither too easy nor too difficult, as the storyteller earns points if some
                but not all players guess their card correctly.</p>
            <p>The game continues in this manner, with each player taking turns as the storyteller, until the final round
                is played. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!</p>

            <h3>Tips and Strategies to Win!</h3>
            <p>1. Creativity and Imagination: Don't be afraid to think outside the box when giving clues or interpreting
                artwork. Creativity and imagination are key to success in Dixit.</p>
            <p>2. Vary Your Clues: Try to mix up your clues throughout the game to keep other players guessing. Avoid
                using the same style of clues repeatedly.</p>
            <p>3. Observe Other Players: Pay attention to how other players give clues and interpret cards. Understanding
                their tendencies can help you make better guesses during their turns.</p>
            <p>4. Read the Table: Analyze the cards played in previous rounds to gauge players' inclinations and the types
                of cards they might have in their hands.</p>
            <p>5. Balance Your Points: As the storyteller, aim to have some but not all players guess your card correctly
                to maximize your points. As a guesser, consider voting strategically to prevent others from gaining too
                many points.</p>
