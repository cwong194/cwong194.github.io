            <h3>Meet the Creator</h3>
            <p>Hello, I'm Ching Nam Wong, a web developer in Seneca College.</p>
            <p>My love for storytelling and creativity drew me to Dixit, as it seamlessly combines the joy of gameplay
                with the magic of imagination. The game's unique concept of using abstract and surreal artwork as the
                basis for storytelling sparked my curiosity from the very beginning.</p>
            <p>I have always believed that games have the power to bring people together, and Dixit does just that. Its
                social nature and engaging gameplay make it a perfect choice for gatherings with friends and family,
                creating cherished memories with each play.</p>
